# Agent Signup Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED  
**Completion Date**: December 18, 2025  
**Time to Implement**: ~45 minutes (Quick Fix + Full Integration)

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Migration ✅
- Added `'agent'` to profiles table `user_type` CHECK constraint
- Created `agents` table with comprehensive agent-specific fields:
  - `profile_id` (FK to profiles)
  - `license_number` (unique)
  - `agency_name`
  - `specialization` (array field)
  - `verified` boolean for admin approval
  - `rating`, `phone`, `whatsapp`, `bio`
  - `profile_photo_url`, `cover_photo_url`
  - `listing_count`, `completed_sales`, `response_time_hours`
  - Timestamps for audit trail

- Added RLS policies:
  - Users can read verified agents
  - Agents can read/update own profile
  - Admins can manage all agents

### 2. Backend Auth Functions ✅
**File**: `lib/auth.ts`

Updated `signUpWithPassword()` to accept `agent` as user type:
```typescript
export async function signUpWithPassword(
  email: string,
  password: string,
  fullName: string,
  userType: "buyer" | "property_owner" | "agent"  // Added agent
): Promise<AuthResponse>
```

New `signUpWithAgent()` function:
```typescript
export async function signUpWithAgent(
  email: string,
  password: string,
  fullName: string,
  licenseNumber: string,
  agencyName: string,
  specialization: string[]
): Promise<AuthResponse>
